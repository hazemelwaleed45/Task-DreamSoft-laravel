Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse, the API has a rate limit of 100 requests per hour per IP address. This is configured in Laravelâ€™s Throttle middleware.

Security
The API employs IP whitelisting to restrict access. Only requests from the specified IP addresses will be allowed. You can manage the list of allowed IPs using environment variables.
